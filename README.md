# Arena

Arena is a browser based, extensible, plugin-driven, peer to peer multiplayer game arena based on [Composer](https://composer.dxos.org), an extensible application environment built on the [DXOS](https://dxos.org) platform.

[ðŸŽ® Arena demo](https://arena-app.vercel.app)

## Getting Started

### Run

Run the app with `pnpm`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm serve
```

### Build

Build the app to the `out` folder

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Test

Run vitest tests with `pnpm`

```bash
pnpm test
```

or in watch mode with:

```bash
pnpm test watch
```

## Games

Currently, Arena supports a variety of games, including:
- **Chess**: The classic game of strategy and tactics.
- **Connect Four Advanced 3D (4x4x4)**: A three-dimensional twist on the beloved game, offering a complex and thrilling challenge.

**Missing your favorite game?** We're looking to expand Arena's collection. If you're interested in adding a new game, we welcome your contributions! Please feel free to submit a pull request.

### Implementing a new game plugin

When adding a new game to the arena-app, you'll be creating a game plugin that integrates with the overall app framework as well as game plugin host.

#### Understanding the plugin framework

The plugin architecture is based on the [@dxos/app-framework](https://github.com/dxos/dxos/tree/main/packages/sdk/app-framework), which facilitates the integration of new functionalities, such as games, into the app. A plugin typically includes metadata (meta) and capabilities it provides (provides), among other configurations.

The arena-app includes a core game plugin host that facilitates the management of individual game plugins. This core plugin exposes:

- [GameProvides](https://github.com/dxos/arena-app/blob/main/src/plugins/Game/GameProvides.ts) interface: This interface defines the contract that your game plugin must fulfill to integrate with the arena-app. It specifies the structure for game metadata, initialization, player assignment, and more.

- `shouldRenderGame` Helper Function: This utility helps determine whether your game should render a `surface`.

Game state is persisted and replicated using [ECHO](https://docs.dxos.org/guide/platform/). You will need to be familiar with creating, querying and manipulating [ECHO objects](https://docs.dxos.org/guide/platform/#objects) as well as interacting with [ECHO spaces](https://docs.dxos.org/guide/platform/#spaces).

It's important to note that different games have different rendering and data requirements to the plugin makes no assumptions about the shape of the game data or the user interface.

#### A minimal game example

```tsx
// my-game-plugin.tsx
import { PluginDefinition, SurfaceProvides } from "@dxos/app-framework";
import { Expando } from "@dxos/react-client/echo";
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import { match } from "ts-pattern";
import { GameProvides } from "../Game/GameProvides";
import { shouldRenderGame } from "../Game/shouldRenderGame";
import { MyGameSurface } from "./components/MyGameSurface";

// --- Constants and Metadata -------------------------------------------
export const MyGamePluginMeta = { id: "myid", name: "My Game Plugin" };

// --- Plugin Definition ------------------------------------------------------
type MyGamePluginProvidesCapabilities = SurfaceProvides & GameProvides;

export default function MyGamePlugin(): PluginDefinition<MyGamePluginProvidesCapabilities> {
  return {
    meta: MyGamePluginMeta,

    provides: {
      context: (props: PropsWithChildren) => <>{props.children}</>,
      surface: {
        component: ({ data, role }) => {
          if (shouldRenderGame(data, role, MyGamePluginMeta.id)) {
            return <MyGameSurface id={data.instanceId} />;
          }

          return null;
        },
      },
      game: {
        id: MyGamePluginMeta.id,
        displayName: "My Game Plugin",
        variations: [{ displayName: "Standard", id: "standard" }],
        timeControlOptions: undefined,

        createGame(room, id, variation, _timeControl, players, ordering) {
					// Initialise any starting game state, move arrays, etc. here
          let game = { }

          const players = match(ordering)
            .with("creator-first", () => ({
              player1: players.creatorId,
              player2: players.challengerId,
            }))
            .with("challenger-first", () => ({
              player1: players.challengerId,
              player2: players.creatorId,
            }))
            .with("random", () => {
              const random = Math.random() > 0.5;
              return {
                player1: random ? players.creatorId : players.challengerId,
                player2: random ? players.challengerId : players.creatorId,
              };
            })
            .exhaustive();

          game.players = players;

          room.db.add(new Expando({ type: "game-my-game-type", gameId: id, ...game }));
        },
      },
    },
  };
}
```

The rendered game surface is provided with some ECHO object ID, it's the game plugin authors responsibility to query and mutate the game object as required. Here's an example for a simple game surface:

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "@dxos/react-client/echo";
import { useActiveRoom } from "../../RoomManager/hooks/useActiveRoom";

export function MyGameSurface({ id }: { id: string }) {
  const space = useActiveRoom();
  let [dbGame] = useQuery(space, { type: "game-my-game-type", gameId: id });

  if (!dbGame) return null;

  return (
    <div>
      <GameImplementation game={dbGame as any as GameState} >
    </div>
  );
}
```
